# Observed Relationships in the data (generally at the state level seems to be appropriate for exploration
"""
cs_educ_ba (graduated from college) - cs_fam_wkidsinglemom (single mom)
rel_tot (percent religious) - cs_fam_wkidsinglemom (single mom)
cs_elf_ind_man (proportion working in manufacturing) - cs_educ_ba (graduated from college)
cs_educ_ba (graduated from college) - cs_labforce (labor force participation)
cs_educ_ba (graduated from college) - hhinc00 (household income)
cs_educ_ba (graduated from college) - poor_share (share of pop in poverty)
cs_educ_ba (graduated from college) - tuition (cost of tuition) (interesting b/c no relationship)
subcty_exp_pc (local gov't spending) - taxrate (local government tax rate)
cs_born_foreign (share of pop foreign born) - crime_total (local crime rate) (no relationship observed)
dropout_r (high school dropouts) - crime_total (crime rate) (some states have strong relationship, others not so much)

General Ideas for a story to tell with the Data:
- Confronting Stereotypes
  - explore and share if this data supports stereotypes about health, education, crime, etc.
  - one interesting one to consider is surrounding percentage of foreign born data
    - less crime, lower obesity, fewer single moms, less smoking, fewer high school dropouts
      generally are moving to areas others are moving away from,
- Why are they leaving?
  - Consider areas people are migrating away from and show how those areas differ the most from
    areas people are staying in or moving to
  - again misconceptions could be interesting, like considering household income, home value, crime,
    education, etc.
- Which features are correlated?
  - Can make a SPLOM of select features -- either we curate these manually or programatically (i.e. try to fit line/curve to pair-plots)
  - Can let users select multiple features from a list (maybe with checkboxes)
- Which counties are most similar to each other?
  - Conjecture: this will not align with states: i.e. counties containing large cities will probably be more similar.
  - Might be too much for this homework, but we could maybe run clustering algorithms using these features.

Our design in greater detail:
- A single map showing the entire US with charts showing aggregate statistics on the right
  or maybe under the main plot (configurable displays, but maybe only show set combinations)
- The ability to compare two states with a choropleth display of the state's outline and a
  selected feature to compare more broadly.
    - sub-plots below compare the states more directly in different areas.
- Can guide a viewer through a story to expose differences between the Northeast and Southeast,
  mid-west and south-west, and/or the pacific north-west.
  A map from state to region can be found here: https://github.com/cphalpert/census-regions/blob/master/us%20census%20bureau%20regions%20and%20divisions.csv.
