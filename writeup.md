Our project considered the key indicators of social mobility in American society through the lens of
economic, health, and education indicators.

## Project Goals



## Design

After selecting a dataset, we began by sketching a few initial designs independently.

[TODO: link initial sketches?](link_placeholder)

Our data has a fundamentally geographic component which we thought should be clearly shared through the use of a map for
country-wide comparisons. This medium is difficult to show smaller changes and make comparisons between different
attributes of the same state and for this, we allowed a user to interact with the choropleth map to identify the state they
wanted more information about.

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

We began with sketching and came up with a handful of initial designs that we shared and used as a guide for our initial
work.  This initial exploration based on our intuitions about the data lead us to explore the data and interactions
between different attributes. After we both created many plots and iteratively improved them, we came up with a final design
and were (mostly) able to use our initial analysis in a streamlined way.

## Success Story

TODO:  **A success story of your project.** Describe an insight or discovery you gain with your application that relates to the goals of your project.

It was interesting to me that many of the "negative" factors seemed uncorrlated with % forgien born, particularly poverty rate, as this is one of the strongest stereotypes towards immigrants in the US.
