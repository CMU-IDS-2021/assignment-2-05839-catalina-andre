One does not have to look far or hard to find political commentary peddling the dangers of allowing widespread 
immigration into the United States. When many voices speak with authority, it can be difficult to know what to listen 
to and how to distinguish fact from fiction. While data may not be perfect, and we certainly do not claim to be, we 
think that by exploring some of the statistics behind the claims, we can offer a different perspective. For our 
analysis we considered 
[this summary](https://www.cato.org/blog/14-most-common-arguments-against-immigration-why-theyre-wrong) of common
arguments against liberal immigration policies in America. It is written by 
[Alex Nowrasteh](https://www.cato.org/people/alex-nowrasteh), the Director of Immigration Studies at the Center For
Global Liberty And Prosperity within the [CATO Institute](https://www.cato.org). The CATO institute is a Washington DC
based think tank that has been in operation since the late 1970s.  While Mr. Nowrasteh offers some economic and
theoretical counter arguments to common immigration concerns, we visualized data made available by Raj Chetty's 
(Harvard University) group, [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org), that studies social mobility 
within America to augment Mr. Nowrasteh's arguments.

## Project Goals

TODO: **A clear description of the goals of your project.** Describe the question that you are enabling a user to answer. The question should be compelling and the solution should be focused on helping users achieve their goals.Â 

## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?

After selecting a dataset, we began by sketching a few initial designs independently.

Our data has a fundamentally geographic component which we thought should be clearly shared through the use of a map for
country-wide comparisons. This medium is difficult to show smaller changes and make comparisons between different
attributes of the same state and for this, we allowed a user to interact with the map to identify the state they wanted
more information about.

## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

We began with sketching and came up with a handful of initial designs that we shared and used as a guide for our initial
work.  This initial exploration based on our intuitions about the data lead us to explore the data and interactions
between different attributes.

## Success Story

TODO:  **A success story of your project.** Describe an insight or discovery you gain with your application that relates to the goals of your project.
